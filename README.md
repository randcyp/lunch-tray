The last exercise for "Unit 3: Navigation" in the "Android Basics in Kotlin" course (https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-training-project-lunch-tray)

It is in no way super difficult by any means, but I did spend ~2 hours doing it. It's also one of the more interesting (and challenging) exercises without a solution, so here's my solution!
